# RMSquad
A tool to help working on Rpg Maker Vx Ace projects as a team, made using [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com)!

## Special Thanks
To [lavendersiren](https://rpgmaker.net/users/lavendersiren/) for the idea of converting the marshalled RM project structures to YAML to make git usable for a Vx Ace project.
